# ESA UI Design — v1.1

This document describes the UI **as built**. It supersedes `UIDesign-v1.0.md`, which was a forward-looking spec;
where the implementation diverged from that plan, the divergence is recorded here as the current design.

The **staged-changes editing model** (§2.3.1) replaces v1.0's Item Panel and Creation Panel outright. It is
implemented; §3.4 records the limits that remain.

Stack: Nuxt 4 + Nuxt UI v4 + Tailwind. All components live in `app/`; no other UI library is used.

## 1. App Overview

### 1.1 Shell (`app/app.vue`)

`UApp` wrapping a full-height column: a sticky, blurred header over a `<main>` that renders `<NuxtPage />`.

| Element      | Component                            | Behavior                                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Logo         | `NuxtLink` + `UIcon` (cube, primary) | "ESA" wordmark; navigates to `/`                              |
| Navigation   | `Navbar.vue`                         | See §2.1                                                      |
| Theme toggle | `UButton` (ghost, neutral)           | Toggles `useColorMode()` between light/dark; icon is sun/moon |

Container width is widened globally to `--ui-container: 95%` (`app/assets/css/main.css`), so pages using
`UContainer` span nearly the full viewport.

| Shell state | Trigger                   | Appearance                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Light       | `colorMode !== 'dark'`    | White surfaces, sun icon on the toggle   |
| Dark        | `colorMode === 'dark'`    | `gray-900` surfaces, moon icon on toggle |

### 1.2 Routes

| Route             | File                        | Status                                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/`               | `pages/index.vue`           | **Template boilerplate** — user list, profile-picture upload modal, logout. Not part of the ESA design.        |
| `/auth`           | `pages/auth.vue`            | Implemented (§1.3)                                                                                            |
| `/database`       | `pages/database.vue`        | Implemented (§3)                                                                                              |
| `/team-formation` | `pages/team-formation.vue`  | Implemented (§4)                                                                                              |
| `/automation`     | `pages/automation.vue`      | Placeholder — a single neutral `UAlert` reading "This page is not yet implemented."                            |
| `/users`          | `pages/users.vue`           | Implemented, admin-only (§5)                                                                                    |
| `/inactive`       | `pages/inactive.vue`        | Implemented (§1.4) — shown in place of any route while `session.user.active` is false                          |

### 1.3 Authentication

`app/middleware/auth.global.ts` runs on every navigation:

| Session | `user.active` | Target route              | Result                      |
| ------- | -------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Present | —              | `/auth`                     | Redirect to `/`              |
| Present | `false`        | anything but `/inactive`    | Redirect to `/inactive`      |
| Present | `false`        | `/inactive`                  | Allowed                      |
| Present | `true`         | `/inactive`                  | Redirect to `/`              |
| Present | `true`         | `/users`, not `ADMIN`        | 403 "Admins only"            |
| Present | `true`         | anything else                | Allowed                      |
| Absent  | —              | `/auth`                     | Allowed                      |
| Absent  | —              | anything else                | Redirect to `/auth`          |

**Login page** (`pages/auth.vue`) — a centered `UCard` titled "Login" containing a two-step `UForm` with a Zod
schema that widens once the OTP has been sent. Email-OTP only; there is no password field.

| State                        | Fields shown              | Submit button | On success                                   | On error                          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `isEmailSent === false`      | Email `UInput`            | "Send OTP"    | Success toast; advances to the OTP state      | Error toast with the auth message |
| `isEmailSent === true`       | 6-digit `UPinInput` (otp) | "Login"       | External navigation to `/`                    | Error toast with the auth message |

Logging in requires an email that already exists in the `user` table. The OTP arrives by Nodemailer, or can be read
from the `verification` table in Prisma Studio.

### 1.4 Account Activation

A new `user` row starts with `active = false` (`prisma/schema.prisma` default) until an admin activates it from
`/users` (§5). `role` and `active` are both registered as Better Auth `user.additionalFields`
(`server/utils/auth.ts`) with `input: false`, so they ride along on `session.user` but a signed-in user can never
set either on themselves through `updateUser`.

| Layer    | Enforcement                                                                                                    |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend | `auth.global.ts` (above) redirects any inactive session to `pages/inactive.vue` — a centered card explaining the account needs admin approval, with a Log Out button — and bounces an active session away from `/inactive`. |
| Server   | `server/middleware/authMiddleware.ts` runs on every request; for a session where `user.active === false` it 403s any `/api/**` route other than `/api/auth/**`, so sign-in/sign-out/session calls keep working while every other endpoint (including the ones a page's SSR fetch would hit) is blocked regardless of what the frontend redirect does. |

Because the Nitro middleware checks the session directly, an inactive user cannot reach any data endpoint by
calling it directly, even if a client-side redirect were bypassed.

## 2. Shared Components

### 2.1 Navbar (`components/Navbar.vue`)

A `UNavigationMenu` plus a trailing Logout button.

| Item            | Icon                  | Target            |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- |
| Database        | circle-stack          | `/database`       |
| Team Formation  | user-group            | `/team-formation` |
| Automation      | bolt                  | `/automation`     |
| User Management | shield-check          | `/users`          |
| Logout          | arrow-right-on-rect.  | Calls `authClient.signOut()`, then navigates to `/auth` with a full reload |

User Management is only shown when `session.value.user.role === 'ADMIN'`; the route itself is also gated
(§1.3) so a non-admin who navigates there directly gets a 403 rather than an empty page — see §5.

### 2.2 Semester Filter (`components/SemesterFilter.vue`)

`v-model` is a `semesterId | undefined`. The component is **fully controlled** — an explicit `modelValue` prop plus
an `update:modelValue` emit, not `defineModel` — because `defineModel` keeps a local value, and a caller that
declines a change (§2.3.2, §3) needs the dropdown to keep showing the semester the page actually adopted rather
than snapping to whatever was picked before the decline. Backed by `useSemesters()` (`composables/useSemesters.ts`),
which fetches `/api/semesters` under the shared key `semesters` so every mounted instance shares one cache and one
refresh.

| Sub-element          | Component                | Visible when          | Action / result                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Semester Selection   | `USelectMenu` (w-48)     | Always                | Sets the model; placeholder "All Semesters" when unset. Labels read `Fall 2025`. |
| Semester Clear       | `UButton` ✗ (ghost)      | A semester is selected| Resets the model to `undefined`                                                  |
| Delete Semester      | `UButton` − (error/soft) | A semester is selected| Opens the Confirmation Modal; on confirm `DELETE /api/semesters/:id`, refreshes the list, clears the selection. Failures surface as an error toast. |
| Add Semester         | `UButton` + (soft)       | Always                | Opens the Create Semester Modal; on confirm `POST /api/semesters` then refresh   |

| State                        | Condition                                                     | Effect                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Deletable                    | `teamCount + enrollmentCount + choiceCount === 0`              | Delete enabled; tooltip "Delete this semester"                          |
| Locked                       | The semester has any teams, enrollments, or choices            | Delete **disabled**; tooltip explains those records must be removed first |
| Dangling selection recovered | The selected semester disappears from the shared semester list | A watcher clears the model so the filter cannot point at a deleted row  |

**Create Semester Modal** (`components/CreateSemesterModal.vue`) — a `UModal` opened imperatively via
`useOverlay()`; emits `close` with a `SemesterCreate` or `null`.

| Field  | Input                                          | Validation (Zod)                                                     |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Season | `URadioGroup` horizontal — Spring/Summer/Fall  | Enum; defaults to `FALL`                                             |
| Year   | `UInputNumber`                                 | Integer; defaults to the current year; no commas should be displayed |

Footer: Cancel (✗) closes with `null`; Confirm (✓) submits the form.

### 2.3 Data Table (`components/DataTable.vue`)

> See `docs/design/data_table.md` for the full component reference: every prop/emit/slot, the column
> configuration API (`DataTableColumn`, filters, `editable` types, `editable.child` proxy columns),
> rendering details for every cell/row/toolbar state, and worked examples.

A generic `UTable` composition used only for the three **major records** — Partner, Project, Student. Everything
else (Team, Contact, Choice, Enrollment, Membership) renders as a plain list or `UAccordion` 
card inside the parent record's expanded row.

The parent tab supplies data plus a lightweight column definition; the table owns all rendering. The full
`DataTableColumn` shape (filters, the four `editable` types, `editable.child` proxy columns, `required`) and the
component's props/emits are in `data_table.md` §2–§5 — not repeated here. The table body sits in a `max-h-[70vh]`
scroll container with a sticky header.

#### 2.3.1 Staged changes

> See `docs/design/staging.md` for the full API surface of the composables behind this section
> (`useStagedChanges`, `useSemesterFilter`'s guards, `useStagedSave`) and worked examples of staging
> both rows and nested children.

**There are no creation or edit panels.** Creating, editing, and deleting all happen in the table itself, and every
pending change is **staged locally** in one per-table store. The table issues **no API call until Confirm is
pressed**; Cancel throws the entire store away and the table reverts to its fetched data.

| Change kind | How it is staged                                                                 | Row appearance                                              |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Addition    | Add appends a blank draft row; the user fills it in inline and in its expansion   | Light green row highlight                                    |
| Edit        | Any cell or expansion field on an existing row is changed                        | Blue row highlight; each changed field gets a yellow outline |
| Deletion    | Rows are selected, then Delete is pressed                                        | Red row highlight — the row **stays in view**                |

The four highlight colours are the standard Nuxt UI semantic tints, used consistently everywhere a staged change
is shown — including inside expansions: green = being added, blue = being edited, red = marked for deletion,
yellow = this specific field changed.

Rules:

- Setting an edited field back to its original value clears that field's outline; when a row has no changed fields
  left it stops being blue, and when the store empties, Confirm/Cancel disappear on their own.
- Highlight precedence is deletion > edit > addition. Marking a staged **new** row for deletion simply drops it
  from the store rather than colouring it red.
- A deletion-marked row is read-only: its inline inputs and expansion editors are disabled until it is unmarked.
  Delete only ever marks; unmarking a row (or reverting an edit, or dropping an addition) goes through Undo
  instead — selecting it and pressing Delete again does nothing further. Cancel unmarks and reverts everything at
  once.
- Staged new rows are pinned to the top of the first page and are exempt from sorting and column filters, so a
  half-filled row can never be filtered out of view.
- Expansion editors (teams, contacts, choices, semester info — §3) write into the **same** store, so a change made
  inside a row's expansion turns that row blue and is persisted by the same Confirm.

Confirm emits one payload (`StagedPayload` — `created`/`updated`/`deleted`, defined in `staging.md` §1.5)
describing everything staged; the parent translates it into its own API calls (see each tab in §3) and refreshes
afterwards.

#### 2.3.2 Toolbar (above the table)

Add / Delete / Undo / Confirm / Cancel, each issuing no request of its own — only Confirm and Cancel ever talk to
the network, via the `save`/`cancel` payload above. The exact icon and enablement condition for each button is in
`data_table.md` §6.1.

Because Confirm and Cancel are the only write paths, switching the semester filter or switching tabs with staged
changes is a destructive act. Both are **gated**, not restored: `database.vue`'s `provideSemesterFilter()`
(`composables/useSemesterFilter.ts`) asks through the Confirmation Modal first, via `request(next)` for the
semester and `confirmDiscard(description)` for a tab switch, and only moves the semester id or the active tab once
the user confirms — declining leaves both exactly where they were, with no intermediate state to flash or restore.
Switching tabs matters here too: `UTabs` unmounts the inactive panel by default, which would otherwise destroy a
tab's staged changes with no prompt at all.

#### 2.3.3 Column headers

Each header is a small stack: label, then (when configured) a sort control, a filter control, and a filter-clear
button. Sorting, filtering, and pagination are all client-side over the already-fetched rows — see `data_table.md`
§6.2 for each control's component and exact behavior.

#### 2.3.4 Expansion and selection columns

An `expandable` table gets a chevron column that toggles the parent's `#expanded` slot beneath a row (multiple
rows may be open at once); every table gets a checkbox column with a tri-state header checkbox (all/some/none
selected). See `data_table.md` §6.5.

#### 2.3.5 Cells and inline editing

A column renders one of four editors (`text` / `select` / `switch` / `record-search`, the last being
`RecordSearchInput` — §2.5) or, without `editable`, a plain formatted/stringified value. A cell's outline —
none / yellow (edited) / red (invalid) — and whether it's disabled follow the same state a row's highlight does;
the full per-state table, including that a non-`editable` column stays display-only even on a staged new row, is
in `data_table.md` §6.3.

#### 2.3.6 Pagination (below the table)

A rows-per-page `USelectMenu` (10/25/50) and a `UPagination` beneath the table, both client-side over the
already-fetched, filtered, sorted rows. `data_table.md` §6.6 has the full control table and the table's overall
Loading/Empty/Clean/Dirty/Invalid/Saving states.

### 2.4 Confirmation Modal (`components/ConfirmationModal.vue` + `composables/useConfirm.ts`)

`useConfirm()` lazily creates one shared overlay instance and returns a function:
`await useConfirm()({ title, description?, affected?, confirmLabel? }) → boolean`.

| Element        | Source                          | Notes                                                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Title          | `title`                         | Usually "Delete N projects?"                                              |
| Description    | `description`                   | The cascade sentence, e.g. "This will also delete all associated teams…"   |
| Affected list  | `affected: {label, count}[]`    | Bulleted `3 Contacts`, `1 Project` — pluralized automatically; hidden when empty |
| Cancel / Confirm | Footer buttons                | Resolve `false` / `true`; Confirm is red and its label is overridable      |

The modal has no domain knowledge — each caller computes its own cascade counts before opening it.

### 2.5 Record Search Input (`components/RecordSearchInput.vue`)

A generic async-search `USelectMenu` (`ignoreFilter` + `v-model:search-term`) for picking a linked major record.

Out-of-order responses are discarded via a monotonic token, so a slow early query cannot overwrite a newer result.

## 3. Database (`pages/database.vue`)

A `UContainer` with a header row — "Database" plus one `SemesterFilter` — over a `UTabs` with three tabs. The page
owns both the semester id and the active tab, through `provideSemesterFilter()` (§2.3.2, §3.4); a tab no longer
holds either itself.

| Tab      | Component          | Semester filter narrows the list to…                                  |
| -------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Projects | `ProjectsTab.vue`  | Projects with at least one team in that semester                        |
| Students | `StudentsTab.vue`  | Students enrolled that semester **or** mentoring a team that semester   |
| Partners | `PartnersTab.vue`  | Partners owning a project with a team that semester                     |

Each tab fetches its own list with a reactive `semesterId` query param — read from `useSemesterFilter()` — and
re-fetches whenever the id moves. No semester selected means no filtering. Because the id only moves after the page
has asked and the user has confirmed (§2.3.2), a tab never refetches out from under an open confirmation dialog.

### 3.1 Projects Tab

Description moved off the table and into the expanded row (§3.1.3), alongside the team detail.

Meeting Day reflects the project's team for the selected semester. When the project has no team that semester the
cell reads `—` and is not editable — a team must first be added from the expanded row (§3.1.3/§3.1.4). When a team
exists, editing this cell stages an update to that team's `meetingDay`.

| Action  | Result                                                                                                                                     |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Add     | Appends a green draft row, pre-expanded. Name/Type/Status/GitHub Link/Partner are typed inline; Description and any initial Teams are set in the expansion. Nothing is sent. |
| Edit    | Editing any cell or expansion field turns the row blue and outlines the changed field yellow. Nothing is sent.                                |
| Delete  | Marks the selected rows red. Nothing is sent.                                                                                                |
| Confirm | If any deletions are staged, first opens the Confirmation Modal listing the total affected **Teams**. Then, in order: `POST /api/projects` per created row (partner id and nested teams in the payload) → `PUT /api/projects/:id` per edited row (with nested team/membership changes) → `DELETE /api/projects/:id` per deleted row → refresh |
| Cancel  | Discards every staged project, edit, and deletion, including expansion changes                                                                |

#### 3.1.2 New Project Row

A staged row is filled in through the same controls used for editing an existing project.

| Field       | Where          | Input                                   | Notes                                                       |

| Teams       | Expansion      | Team Creation Modal (§3.1.4)             | Optional; each staged team is listed green                     |

#### 3.1.3 Expanded Row — Description and Teams

The expanded row is a Description field (`UTextarea`, edited directly in place — there is no separate edit mode)
over a **Teams** heading with an "Add Team" button, over the project's team cards.

| Semester filter | Teams shown                                                | Card behavior                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Unset            | Every team, sorted most-recent-semester first                | Multi-open `UAccordion`, collapsible; label reads `Fall 2025 — Wednesday`      |
| Set               | Only that semester's team, if one exists                     | A single, **non-collapsible** card — no accordion chrome                       |

Every action here stages a change on the parent project row — no request is made until the table's Confirm.

| Element               | Action                                                                                                    | Staged appearance                       |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Add Team               | Opens the Team Creation Modal and appends the result                                                     | New team card tinted green                |
| Delete Team            | Marks that team for deletion; the card stays in place and its members are locked                          | Team card tinted red                      |
| Mentors list           | One bordered row per membership with `isMentor = true`; "Add Mentor" + button                             | —                                          |
| Students list          | One bordered row per membership with `isMentor = false`; "Add Student" + button                           | —                                          |
| Add Mentor / Student   | Opens the Member Creation Modal and appends the picked student to that list                                | Member row tinted green                   |
| Move (per member)      | Opens the Move Student Modal; on confirm, stages that membership as deleted from this team and stages a new membership on the chosen destination team | Member row tinted red here; a new green row appears on the destination team's card |
| Remove (per member)    | Marks that membership for deletion; the row stays in view                                                  | Member row tinted red                     |
| Undo (on a staged row) | Available on any green, blue, or red item — drops a staged addition, reverts an edit, or unmarks a deletion | Returns to normal                          |

Any staged team or membership change — including a Move, which touches two team cards at once — turns the parent
project row blue. Nothing is written until the table's Confirm.

#### 3.1.4 Team Creation Modal

| Field       | Input                                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Semester    | `USelectMenu` over all semesters                        |
| Meeting Day | `URadioGroup` horizontal — Wednesday / Thursday           |

Zod-validated. Confirm **stages** `{ semesterId, meetingDay }` on the project (as a nested create) and closes;
it issues no request. Cancel discards the modal's input only.

#### 3.1.5 Member Creation Modal

Titled "Add Mentor" or "Add Student" depending on which button opened it. Body is a single `RecordSearchInput`
that searches the all-students list by netID or full name, excludes students already on that team (staged
additions included), and caps at 10 results. Confirm is disabled until a student is picked; it **stages**
`{ studentId, isMentor }` on that team and issues no request.

#### 3.1.6 Move Student Modal

Opened from a member row's Move button. Body is a single `USelectMenu` listing the project's **other** teams
(excluding the member's current team), labeled `Fall 2025 — Wednesday`, sourced from the same team list as §3.1.3
including any staged-new teams. Confirm is disabled until a destination is picked.

Confirm stages both halves of the move at once and issues no request:

| Staged change                | Where it appears                                                                        |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Membership marked for deletion | The member's row on the **source** team's card, tinted red                                |
| New membership staged          | A new row on the **destination** team's card, tinted green, carrying the same `isMentor` value |

Cancelling the Move Student Modal discards the move only; the member's row on the source card is unaffected.

### 3.2 Students Tab

#### 3.2.1 Table

| Column       | Field                    | Sort | Filter                                 | Edit                            | Present when              |

| Is Mentor?   | `isMentor`                 | ✓    | multiselect: Mentor / Student              | switch                             | Always                       |
| Meeting Day  | `enrollment.meetingDay`    | ✓    | —                                        | select — Wednesday / Thursday      | A semester is selected       |
| Gender       | `enrollment.gender`        | ✓    | —                                        | select — Male / Female / Other     | A semester is selected       |
| Major        | `enrollment.major`         | ✓    | —                                        | text                               | A semester is selected       |
| Year         | `enrollment.year`          | ✓    | —                                        | select — Freshman…Senior          | A semester is selected       |
| Class        | `enrollment.class`         | ✓    | —                                        | select — EPCS_2200 / EPCS_3200     | A semester is selected       |

All five semester-specific columns read from the student's **Enrollment** record for the selected semester — not
from any Membership. A student who only mentors that semester (no enrollment) shows `—` in all five and they are
not editable there; an enrollment must exist first, created via Add Semester Info in the expansion (§3.2.5).
Editing one of these cells stages the same change as editing the matching field on that semester's card in the
expansion (§3.2.3) — the two surfaces share one staged edit.

| Confirm | If deletions are staged, first opens the Confirmation Modal listing affected **Enrollments**, **Choices**, and **Memberships**. Then `POST /api/students` per created row (with nested enrollments/memberships/choices) → `PUT /api/students/:id` per edited row → `DELETE /api/students/:id` per deleted row → refresh |
| Cancel  | Discards every staged student, edit, and deletion                                                                                                      |

| Discord    | Inline cell | `UInput`      | Sent as `undefined` when blank              |
| Is Mentor? | Inline cell | `USwitch`     | Defaults off; drives the Role field in §3.2.5 |
| Semester Info | Expansion | Semester Info Creation Modal (§3.2.5) | Optional; each staged entry is listed green |

#### 3.2.3 Expanded Row — Semester Info

A **Semester Info** heading with an "Add Semester Info" button over a multi-open `UAccordion` of per-semester
cards, filtered to the selected semester when one is set and sorted most-recent first.

Cards are derived from the student's records: every enrollment produces a `Student` card, and every mentor
membership produces a `Mentor` card, so a student who mentors and enrolls in the same semester gets two. Labels
read `Fall 2025 — Student` / `Fall 2025 — Mentor`.

Every action in a card stages a change on the parent student row; nothing is sent until the table's Confirm. No
field in a card is gated behind an Edit button — every editable field is directly editable in place.

| Card body element      | Present on   | Behavior                                                                                          | Staged appearance                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Add Semester Info (+)   | Header       | Opens the Semester Info Creation Modal; the result is appended as a new card                          | Card tinted green                       |
| Delete Semester Info    | Both roles   | Marks the underlying enrollment or mentor membership for deletion; the card stays                     | Card tinted red, contents locked        |
| Enrollment fields       | Student only | Meeting Day / Gender / Major / Year / Class, each editable in place                                    | Changed field outlined yellow — the same staged edit as the matching column in §3.2.1 |
| Team                    | Both roles   | `RecordSearchInput` over teams with a team that card's semester (searches by project or partner name), editable directly — no separate edit control. Picking a team when previously unassigned stages a new Membership; picking a different team stages an update to the existing one; clearing it stages that Membership's deletion. | Field outlined yellow when changed; an unassigned-to-assigned change is still just an edit on this card, not a separate staged row |
| Team Preferences        | Student only | Ranked list `#1 Project Name`, ordered by rank                                                         | —                                        |
| Add Preference (+)      | Student only | Opens the Team Preference Modal; appends the pick to the list                                          | Preference row tinted green              |
| Move Up / Move Down     | Student only | Reorders the list locally and stages the resulting ranks                                               | Reordered rows outlined yellow           |
| Remove (−)              | Student only | Marks that choice for deletion; the row stays in view                                                  | Preference row tinted red                |

#### 3.2.4 Team Preference Modal

Titled "Add Team Preference". A single `RecordSearchInput` over projects that have a team in that card's semester,
excluding projects the student already chose (staged picks included), searching by project **or** partner name,
capped at 10. The new choice is appended at `max(existing ranks) + 1`. Confirm is disabled until a project is
picked, and **stages** the choice rather than sending it.

#### 3.2.5 Semester Info Creation Modal

| Field       | Input                                     | Shown when                                |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Semester    | `USelectMenu`                                | Always                                        |
| Meeting Day | `USelectMenu` — Wednesday / Thursday          | Always                                        |
| Role        | `URadioGroup` — Student / Mentor              | Only if the student's mentor flag is set       |
| Major       | `UInput`                                     | Role = Student                                |
| Year        | `USelectMenu` — Freshman…Senior               | Role = Student                                |
| Class       | `USelectMenu` — EPCS_2200 / EPCS_3200         | Role = Student                                |
| Gender      | `USelectMenu` — Male / Female / Other         | Role = Student                                |
| Team        | `RecordSearchInput` over projects with a team that semester | Optional for either role — leave blank to create the card unassigned and set it later from the card (§3.2.3) |

Confirm **stages** the entry as a new card and issues no request. What the table's Confirm later sends depends on
the role:

| Role staged | Request issued on Confirm                                                                                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Student     | `POST /api/enrollments` with student, semester, meeting day, major, year, class, gender; plus `POST /api/memberships` if a team was picked  |
| Mentor      | `POST /api/memberships` with `isMentor: true`, resolved to the picked project's team for that semester; nothing is sent if left unassigned  |

For a **new** student row, these are sent as nested creates inside the row's `POST /api/students`.
### 3.3 Partners Tab

#### 3.3.1 Table

Rows are partners flattened with their **primary contact** (the contact flagged primary, else the first one), so
the contact columns are editable proxies onto a different record.

| Column  | Field (row)     | Sort | Filter | Edit |
| ------- | --------------- | ---- | ------ | ---- |
| Name    | `name`          | ✓    | search | text |
| Contact | `primaryName`   | ✓    | search | text |
| Email   | `primaryEmail`  | ✓    | search | text |
| Phone   | `primaryPhone`  | ✓    | search | text |

| Action  | Result                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Add     | Appends a green draft row (Name inline, contacts in the expansion). Nothing is sent.                                                                              |
| Edit    | Row turns blue, changed field outlined yellow — including the three contact-proxy columns. Nothing is sent.                                                       |
| Delete  | Marks the selected rows red. Nothing is sent.                                                                                                                    |
| Confirm | If deletions are staged, first opens the Confirmation Modal listing affected **Contacts** and **Projects**. Then each row's changes are split: partner fields → `POST`/`PUT /api/partners/:id`; contact fields → `PUT /api/contacts/:id` for the primary contact, or `POST /api/contacts` when the partner has none (nested into the partner create for a new row); then `DELETE /api/partners/:id` per deleted row → refresh |
| Cancel  | Discards every staged partner, edit, and deletion, including contact changes                                                                                     |

Editing a contact-proxy column and editing that same contact's card in the expansion are the same staged change —
whichever is touched last wins, and both surfaces show the yellow outline.

#### 3.3.2 Expanded Row — Contacts and Projects

**Contacts** — a heading with "Add Contact" over a list of bordered cards. Fields are edited in place; every
action stages a change on the parent partner row and issues no request.

| Card state        | Contents                                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Display           | Name, Email, Phone as ghost inputs (`—` placeholder when blank), a "Primary" `UBadge` when applicable, plus the action buttons |
| Edited            | Same, with each changed field outlined yellow                                                                          |
| Staged addition   | Whole card tinted green                                                                                                |
| Marked for deletion | Whole card tinted red, inputs disabled                                                                               |

| Button       | Visible when                    | Result                                                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Add Contact  | Header                          | Opens the Contact Creation Modal; the result is appended as a green card     |
| Make Primary | Contact is not primary          | Stages `isPrimary: true` on that contact (and clears it on the previous primary) |
| Delete       | Card is clean or edited         | Marks the contact for deletion; the card stays in view                      |
| Undo         | Card is staged green, blue, or red | Drops a staged addition, reverts an edit, or unmarks a deletion          |

**Projects** — a plain read-only list of the partner's project names, narrowed to projects with a team in the
selected semester when a filter is set. Projects are created from the Projects tab, not here.

#### 3.3.3 Contact Creation Modal

| Field | Input    | Notes                                    |
| ----- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Name  | `UInput` | Required                                 |
| Phone | `UInput` | Sent as `undefined` when blank            |
| Email | `UInput` |                                          |

Confirm **stages** the contact under the parent partner and closes; the `POST /api/contacts` (or the nested create
on a new partner) happens on the table's Confirm.

### 3.4 Implementation notes and known limits (Database)

The staged-changes model is **built** — `docs/design/staging.md` is the composable-level reference (the
store's full API, the semester/tab discard gate, the shared Confirm envelope). `RecordPanel.vue` is
deleted.

Staged changes survive neither a tab switch nor a semester change without an explicit Discard: both are gated
through `useSemesterFilter()` (§2.3.2, §3), so the user is asked before either happens, and a decline leaves the
staged work and the current tab/semester untouched. What remains:

| Limit                       | Behavior today                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Item Panel                  | Not planned. Record detail lives in expandable rows, and clicking a record name does nothing.                     |
| Proxy columns on a new row  | `editable.child` resolves against the fetched record, so a column cannot proxy a **staged-new** child. On a brand-new project row Meeting Day stays read-only; set the day in the Team Creation Modal instead. |
| Accordion tinting           | `UAccordion` exposes no per-item hook for its trigger, so in the semester-unset view a staged-green or -red team tints its body but not its header. |
| Staged primary contact      | The Partners contact-proxy columns target the **fetched** primary, so after a staged Make Primary those columns keep editing the previous primary until Confirm. |
| Team change is delete+create| There is no `PUT /api/memberships/:id`, so re-pointing a student at another team stages a delete plus a create. The Students tab re-collapses that pair into one card; the Projects tab's Move does the same across two cards. |
| Primary not promoted        | `contactService.deleteContact` does not promote a replacement primary, so deleting a partner's primary contact leaves the partner with none (the table then falls back to the first contact for display). |
| Clearing a record search    | `RecordSearchInput` has no `clearable`, so a card that needs an unset action renders its own ✗ button beside it.  |

Choice reordering deliberately stages a new rank on **only** the moved choice: `choiceService.updateChoice`
already shifts siblings, so rewriting every rank would fight it.

The proxy-column, staged-primary-contact, and delete+create rows above are mechanism-level consequences
of how `useStagedChanges`'s `children`/`fields` resolve targets, not independent quirks — see
`docs/design/staging.md` §7 for why each one falls out of the store's design.

#### 3.4.1 Shared composables and utils

Code that used to be duplicated across the three tabs now lives in one place:

| Module                                    | Purpose                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `composables/useSemesterFilter.ts`         | `provideSemesterFilter()` / `useSemesterFilter()` — the gated semester id and active tab (§2.3.2, §3)  |
| `composables/useStagedSave.ts`             | `useStagedSave()` — the Confirm envelope shared by all three tabs: delete confirmation, `saving`, create→update→delete ordering, `staging.reset()`, refresh, one error toast |
| `composables/useRecordModals.ts`           | `useRecordModals()` — awaited `useOverlay()` openers for the six minor-record modals, normalizing an ESC/outside-click dismissal to `null` |
| `composables/useRowStaging.ts`             | `provideRowStaging()` / `useRowStaging()` — ambient `{staging, saving}` for components rendered inside a row's expansion |
| `composables/useSemesterCards.ts`          | The Students tab's per-semester card derivation (§3.2.3): `cardsFor`, `membershipSlot`, `setTeam`, `choiceEntries`, `moveChoice`, `deleteCard`, `undoCard`, plus the `StudentRow`/`SemesterCard`/`ChoiceEntry` types |
| `composables/useDirectory.ts`              | `useAllPartners()` / `useAllProjects()` / `useAllStudents()` — keyed fetches any component can call without issuing a new request |
| `composables/useSemesters.ts`              | Gained `useSemesterLookup()` — `semesterLabel(id)`, `semesterSortKey(id)`, `semesterOptions`, `teamLabel(team)` |
| `composables/useStagedChanges.ts`          | Gained `STAGE_TINTS` (the green/blue/red tint classes) and `groupChildren(children)`                  |
| `utils/labels.ts`                          | Display formatting: `titleCase`, `plural`, `formatSemester`, `semesterOrder`, `studentLabel`, `projectLabel` |
| `utils/options.ts`                         | Every enum option list (`MEETING_DAY_OPTIONS`, `GENDER_OPTIONS`, …), `ENROLLMENT_FIELDS`, `dayLabel`  |
| `utils/columns.ts`                         | `textColumn()` / `enumColumn()` — builders for the two `DataTableColumn` shapes that repeat across tabs |
| `utils/search.ts`                          | Client-side typeahead filters (`searchPartners`, `searchStudents`, `searchProjects`) for `RecordSearchInput` |
| `utils/errors.ts`                          | `errorMessage()` — the message buried in a `$fetch` rejection                                          |
| `utils/recordDrafts.ts`                    | The draft types each minor-record modal resolves with (`ContactDraft`, `TeamDraft`, `SemesterInfoDraft`) |

New components backing the modals and row expansions: `ModalFooter.vue`, `ContactFormModal.vue`,
`TeamFormModal.vue`, `MemberPickerModal.vue`, `MoveMemberModal.vue`, `ProjectPickerModal.vue`,
`SemesterInfoModal.vue`, `PartnerContactList.vue`, `ProjectTeamCard.vue`, `ProjectRowExpansion.vue`,
`StudentSemesterCard.vue`. The Projects tab in particular used to render its ~90-line team-card body twice — once
for the semester-set view, once inside the semester-unset `UAccordion` — and now renders both through the single
`ProjectTeamCard`, with only the wrapper differing.

---

## 4. Team Formation (`pages/team-formation.vue`)

One narrow page (`max-w-4xl`) of three numbered sections separated by `USeparator`. The v1.0 stepper was
flattened into stacked sections: all three are visible at once, and each guards itself with disabled controls and
hint text rather than blocking progression.

### 4.1 Section 1 — Semester & Meeting Day

| Element        | Component                                          | Behavior                                                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Semester       | `SemesterFilter` inside a `UFormField`             | Full filter, including Add/Delete Semester (§2.2)                 |
| Meeting Day    | `URadioGroup` — Wednesday / Thursday                | Defaults to Wednesday; drives sections 1–3                        |
| Export Teams   | `UButton` (↓ tray, soft)                            | Disabled until a semester and day are set; see §4.2               |
| Teams list     | Bordered rows, `Project — Partner` + member count   | Only rendered once a semester is selected                         |

| State              | Condition                                                   | Appearance                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| No semester        | `semesterId` unset                                           | Teams list hidden; upload disabled; generation disabled                         |
| No teams for day   | Fetch settled and no team matches the semester + day          | Warning `UAlert` "No teams found" pointing the user at the Database tab         |
| Teams present      | ≥1 matching team                                             | The list, each row showing its current membership count                         |

### 4.2 Team Export

Downloads `Wed Teams - Fall-2025.csv` (or `Thu …`) built entirely client-side from the already-fetched data. One
row per membership on a team matching the selected day:

| Column                                                   | Source                                                        |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Team                                                     | `F25 - Partner Name: Project Name`                             |
| Student                                                  | `Last, First`                                                  |
| Choice 1 … Choice 6                                      | The student's ranked choices for that semester, blank-padded to 6 |
| Student Major / Student Classification / Gender / Skills / Comments | The student's enrollment for that semester (skills joined with `; `) |

### 4.3 Section 2 — Bid File

| Element         | Component                    | Behavior                                                                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bid Response CSV| `UFileUpload` (accept `.csv`)| Disabled until a semester is chosen; hint text "Select a semester above first." |
| Upload          | `UButton` (↑ tray)           | Enabled only when a semester is set and the parsed file is error-free      |

Selecting a file parses and validates it in the browser (`utils/bidCsv.ts`) **before** anything is sent. Validation
checks that each required column group is present under one of its accepted header spellings — Student Name, SSO
ID, Classification, Enrollment, School and Major, Gender — and then that every row has a Student Name. (The
per-row checks for netID uniqueness, classification, enrollment code, major, and gender are written but currently
commented out.)

| Missing columns  | A required column group has no match      | Error `UAlert` "Missing required columns" listing them; upload blocked        |
| Row errors       | ≥1 row failed                             | Error `UAlert` with the count, plus a scrollable (`max-h-64`) list of `Row N: message`; upload blocked |
| Valid            | No missing columns and no row errors      | Success `UAlert` "N row(s) validated successfully"; upload enabled           |

Submitting `POST`s the parsed rows to `/api/team-formation/bids` with the semester and meeting day as query
params, then refreshes the semester's projects and students. On success the file input is deliberately cleared, so
changing the meeting day and clicking Upload again cannot silently re-import the same roster under the new day.

## 5. User Management (`pages/users.vue`)

Admin-only (§1.3, §2.1). Fetches the full user list from `GET /api/users` (`server/services/userService.ts`) and
splits it client-side into two `UCard` sections by `active` — there is no separate endpoint per group. Each row
shows the avatar (via `getImageLink`, same pattern as the old template list), name, email, and role/verification
badges, with action buttons on the right. There is no staged-changes envelope here (§2.3.1) — every button issues
its `PUT`/`DELETE /api/users/:id` immediately and then `refresh()`s the list; `busyId` disables/loading-spins only
the row currently in flight.

### 5.1 Active Users card

| Column / element | Shown                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Badges             | "Admin" (`role === 'ADMIN'`); "You" (`user.id === session id`)         |
| Promote to Admin   | Shown when `role === 'USER'`. `PUT { role: 'ADMIN' }`, no confirmation |
| Demote to User     | Shown when `role === 'ADMIN'`. Requires confirmation (§2.4) — "`Demote {name}?`" / "will lose admin access". Disabled (with a tooltip) for a self-row when this user is the only admin, so the round-trip to the server's identical check (§5.3) is avoided rather than surfaced as an error. `PUT { role: 'USER' }` |
| Deactivate         | Always shown for an active user. Disabled (with a tooltip) on the signed-in admin's own row. `PUT { active: false }` |

### 5.2 Inactive Users card

| Column / element | Shown                                                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Badge              | "Verified" / "Pending" (`emailVerified`), same as the old placeholder list |
| Activate           | `PUT { active: true }`                                             |
| Delete             | `DELETE /api/users/:id` — no confirmation modal (not required by spec; the action only ever targets an already-inactive account) |

### 5.3 Business rules (`server/services/userService.ts`)

The table above shows what the UI disables proactively; the service enforces the same rules independent of the
client, returning a plain `Error` that each handler maps to a `400`/`404` `createError` (the pattern every other
service in `server/services/` follows — see `semesterService.deleteSemester` for the reference shape):

| Rule                                                                                     | Enforced in           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| An admin cannot deactivate their own account                                              | `updateUser`            |
| A role change is rejected unless the target is (or is being made, in the same call) active | `updateUser`            |
| An admin cannot demote themselves unless at least one other `ADMIN` row exists             | `updateUser`            |
| Only an inactive user can be deleted                                                       | `deleteUser`             |

Endpoints: `GET /api/users` (list, admin-only), `PUT /api/users/:id` (partial `{ active?, role? }`, admin-only),
`DELETE /api/users/:id` (admin-only). All three call `requireAdmin` (`server/utils/authz.ts`) first. Activation and
role are also the account-activation flow described in §1.4 — deactivating a user here is what puts their next
request behind `pages/inactive.vue` and the `active-user` Nitro middleware.

Note that `pages/index.vue` still contains the upstream template's user list and profile-picture upload; it is
boilerplate rather than a design element, and `pages/users.vue`'s avatar/badge rendering is the one part of it
that was reused here.
