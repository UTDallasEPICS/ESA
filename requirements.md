# Requirements

This is the single source of truth for what your hardware project must do. Capture every
requirement as a row in the matrix below, give it a stable ID, and track its status through
the project lifecycle.

> The rows below are **examples** — replace them with your own project's requirements and

## 1. Requirement Matrix

- **Category:** Functional (`REQ-F`) — what the system does; Non-Functional (`REQ-NF`) —
  how well it does it (performance, mechanical, electrical, safety, cost, regulatory).
- **Status:** Backlog, In-progress, Verified, Deferred, Deprecated.
- **Verification:** how you will prove the requirement is met — Test, Demonstration,
  Inspection, or Analysis.
- **Mapping:** the GitHub issue, design doc, drawing, BOM line, or test that satisfies it.
